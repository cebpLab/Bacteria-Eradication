# Bacteria-Eradication
Stochastic simulation codes and graphs for the first passage time of population eradication of bacteria under the influence of antibacterial agents, including antibotic (Ampicillin) and Silver Nanoparticle (AgNP). The algorithm used here is called Time-dependent rejection based stochastic smulation (tRSSA) which a modified form of the well known "Gillespie Algorithm". The codes are for evaluating the first passage time for bacterial extinction in presence of 1.antibiotic alone, 2. AgNP alone and 3. Combination of Ampicillin and AgNP.

The codes are written in python 3.0. All the other details are in the associated manuscript.
